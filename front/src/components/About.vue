            A community health center is a type of clinic that’s community-directed and supported by federal funding.
             They’re aimed at serving communities that may not have access to affordable healthcare.
            To receive federal funding, a community health center must meet the following five criteria:
            offer healthcare services within an area or community that’s classified as medically underserved
            provide comprehensive primary care in conjunction with supportive services like health education and translation
            adjust the costs of services based on an individual’s ability to pay
            be directed by a board that’s predominantly made of community members
            meet additional requirements related to performance, finances, and administration
            In addition to primary care, other services can be integrated into a community health center. Some examples include:

            Rural health clinics serve people who have Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance. The goal of the rural health clinic program is to provide better access to care in rural, underserved communities.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimates that there are about 4,500 rural health clinics in the United States.

Rural health clinics provide medically necessary primary or preventive care. A service is considered medically necessary if it’s required to either diagnose or treat an illness or condition.

If the clinic doesn’t offer a specific service, the clinic staff may be able to arrange for you to receive medically necessary care at a hospital or specialized clinic.

These clinics are typically staffed by the following types of healthcare professionals:

doctors
physicians assistants
nurse practitioners
certified nurse-midwives
clinical psychologists
clinical social workers
